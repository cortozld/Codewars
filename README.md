Personal Codewars Solutions

This folder contains a collection of my solutions for Codewars(https://www.codewars.com/).

In addition to practicing Javascript (for now), this repository is for teaching myself command-line git.

I try to upload at least one solution a day in order to get spaced repetition of both programming languages and the git command-line process.
